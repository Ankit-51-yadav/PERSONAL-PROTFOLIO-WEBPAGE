## DESCRIPTION

This project is a responsive single-page developer portfolio website built using HTML and CSS. It is designed to showcase personal projects, technical skills, certifications, and contact information in a clean and modern layout.

The portfolio follows a section-based structure including Home, About, Skills, Certifications, Projects, and Contact. Smooth navigation allows users to quickly access different sections of the page, providing a good user experience across all devices.

The Home section introduces the developer with a clear role description, key highlights, and quick statistics. The About section explains the developer’s background, mindset, focus areas, and learning approach. A dedicated Skills section displays both a tech stack overview and animated skill progress bars to visually represent proficiency levels.

The Certifications section lists completed courses and training to demonstrate continuous learning. The Projects section highlights major frontend projects with brief descriptions, showing practical experience in building real-world applications. The Contact section includes a structured form layout, making it easy for visitors to reach out.

The website uses modern UI design principles such as cards, gradients, spacing, and responsive grids. CSS animations and hover effects are added to enhance interactivity while keeping the design clean and professional. The layout is fully responsive and adapts well to mobile, tablet, and desktop screens.

This project demonstrates strong fundamentals in HTML structure, CSS styling, responsive design, and UI/UX thinking. It is suitable for use as a personal portfolio and for submission as a frontend internship or entry-level developer project.
